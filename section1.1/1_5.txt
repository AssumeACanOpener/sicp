With applicative order, when the test procedure is evaluated,
it will try and evaluate the arguments to the test procedure.
Since the p procedure argument evaluates to itself this
procedure will again be evauated, and on and on ad infinitum.

With normal order, the arguments aren't evaluated right away.
And since the first argument passed to test is 0, the
p procedure will never need to be evaluated, so the procedure
will return 0.
